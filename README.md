Penguin Subtitle Player is an open-source, cross-platform standalone subtitle player, as an alternative to [Greenfish Subtitle Player](http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Video/Other-VIDEO-Tools/Greenfish-Subtitle-Player.shtml), [SrtViewer (Mac)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/srtviewer/), [SRTPlayer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/subtitleplayer/), [JustSubsPlayer](https://justsubsplayer.codeplex.com/) and [Free Subtitle Player](http://sourceforge.net/projects/freesubtitleplayer/).

You download the subtitle file (`.srt`, `.ssa`, `.ass`, `.vtt`) from any sites you like and load it into the subtitle player. The subtitle player provides a translucent window which always stays on the top so that subtitles can be shown on top of the video without blocking anything.

With Penguin Subtitle Player, just open your favorite online streaming site, load the subtitle file into the player, and enjoy.
